# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules. You can find the official rules under the Resources.


## A brief summary:

If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper
You have been tasked to create a simple version of this game with Python. In this version, one player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player). 

## Usage

"R" for "rock", 
"P" for "paper", 
"S" for "scissors".

When the program is run, the user is to pick an option between "R", "P" or "S"
If user input is invalid (not amongst our options), it prints an error, and ask for their input again

But if there is a winner, it prints the winner, and the program ends.
If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move), it restarts

It prints both player's moves in the format: `Player (Rock) : CPU (Paper)`
